### What We're *Building*

<br />

*From siloed SQL database to*
# Powerful Data Engine

- Connect Directus to your database
- Create instant REST and GraphQL APIs
- Restrict permissions to our data
- Share data with non-technical users
- Build a dashboard without writing code
- Automate a workflow

---

# Prerequisites

Here's what you'll need for the workshop.

- Docker ([download it here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- VS Code ([download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))


<br>

*Duration*
- Budget - roughly 1 hrs

# **Let's Hop In üê∞**

---

# 1. *Download* the sample database

<hr class="mb-4" />

- Create a couple new directories locally - `/data-engine` and `/data-engine/database`
- [Download State of Data DB](https://github.com/directus-labs/workshops/raw/main/database-to-data-engine/database/state-of-data.db) into the `/data-engine/database` directory
    ```markdown
    https://github.com/directus-labs/workshops/raw/main/database-to-data-engine/database/state-of-data.db
    ```
- Open `/data-engine` in VS Code

<style>
    li {
        font-size: 1.5rem !important;
        line-height: 3rem !important;
    }
</style>

---
layout: two-cols
background: '/backgrounds/dark-geo.png'
---

# 2. Create a *Docker Compose* file

<hr class="mb-4" />

- Within `/database-engine` create a new file named <br> `docker-compose.yaml`.
- Copy and paste the code on the right into the file.
- Save the file.
- From your terminal (`‚åòT` within VS Code), run `docker compose up`

::right::
```yml
version: "3"
services:
  directus:
    image: directus/directus:10.10.6
    ports:
      - 8055:8055
    volumes:
      - ./database:/directus/database
      - ./uploads:/directus/uploads
      - ./extensions:/directus/extensions
    environment:
      KEY: "unique-key-here"
      SECRET: "private-secret-here"
      ADMIN_EMAIL: "admin@example.com"
      ADMIN_PASSWORD: "password"
      DB_CLIENT: "sqlite3"
      DB_FILENAME: "/directus/database/state-of-data.db"

```

<style>
    li {
        font-size: 1.2rem !important;
        /* line-height: 3rem !important; */
    }
</style>

# Directus bootstraps onto your database

Your data remains pure. All Directus metadata gets stored in prefixed tables that are simple to delete later if no longer needed.

# BOOM üí•
You've got REST and GraphQL APIs ready to go. Full CRUD in seconds.

### REST

```
GET
http://localhost:8055/items/answers

```
<br>

### GraphQL
```
POST
http://localhost:8055/graphql

query {
    answers {
        id
        answer
        question_id
        survey_response_id
    }
}
```

# Oops Wait A Minute üõë

Hold the presses. Directus keeps your data secure by design (and default). <br>
So we need to adjust permissions.

layout: default
---
# 3. Adjust the Access Control settings

- Login to Directus
- Open [Access Control settings](http://localhost:8055/admin/settings/roles/)
- Public Role
- Add "Read" permissions for each collection


<img src="/permissions.png" class="w-full object-contain rounded-xl border border-gray-300 mt-4"/>

# 4. Test Your New *APIs*

### Get Items
`GET`

```
http://localhost:8055/items/answers
```

<hr class="my-4">

### Get Item
`GET`

```
http://localhost:8055/items/answers/00004f55-c2cc-46bd-a0f2-b8d1a24cf671
```




---

## Global Parameters
<hr class="mb-2">

### `fields`

The REST APIs are GraphQL-like. Allowing you to only fetch the exact fields you want, even relational fields.

```
http://localhost:8055/items/answers?fields=answer,question_id.title,survey_response_id.*
```
<hr class="my-4">

### `filter`
Return items that match specific conditions. See available [Filter Rules](https://docs.directus.io/reference/filter-rules.html)

```
http://localhost:8055/items/answers?filter[question_id][_eq]=gEMB4PWaQ18V
```
<hr class="my-4">

## Global Parameters
<hr class="mb-2">

### `aggregate`

Perform calculations and return a single result for items within a collection.
```
http://localhost:8055/items/answers?aggregate[count]=*
```
<hr class="my-4">

### `groupBy`
Combine with aggregate to group results based on a shared value. You can group by multiple fields at the same time.
```
http://localhost:8055/items/answers?aggregate[count]=*&groupBy[]=question_id&groupBy[]=answer
```
<hr class="my-4">
